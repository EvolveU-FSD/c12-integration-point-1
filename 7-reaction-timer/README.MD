# Reaction time

Optionally start from 5-beginner-stopwatch, but this application is a single button.  

1. It starts enabled with the text "START".
1. When the user clicks it the text changes the "READY"
1. At a random time 4-8 seconds later, the button text changes to "CLICK" and the timer starts
1. When the user clicks the button again, the elapsed time is shown

Optional - use a color change on the button.  "START" is green, "READY" is gray, and "CLICK" is blue

Tip:
Use setTimeout() to execute a callback after a random amount of time
