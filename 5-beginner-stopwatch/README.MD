# Beginner stopwatch

Your goal is to create the start of a simple stopwatch that times the number of milliseconds between two button presses.  This stopwatch has two buttons:

Start - when you press "start" the timer starts
Stop - when you press the "stop" button, the value of the time elapsed in milliseconds is shown in a text box

Style it however you like, but don't spend too much time on it.

You do not need to show the time as it is elapsing (yet)

Tip:  Use "Date.now()" to get the "current time" in milliseconds.
