# Beginner stopwatch

Your goal is to create the start of a simple stopwatch that times the number of milliseconds between two button presses.  This stopwatch has two buttons:

- START - when you press "start" the timer starts
- STOP - when you press the "stop" button, the value of the time elapsed in milliseconds is shown in a text box

Style it however you like, but don't spend too much time styling yet.

You do not need to show the time as it is elapsing (yet), only the value when the user clicks the stop button.

Tip:  Use "Date.now()" to get the "current time" in milliseconds.
