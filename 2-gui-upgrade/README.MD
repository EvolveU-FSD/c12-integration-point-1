# Making changes to the GUI

What you built was great - but the client has looked at it on their phone and wants the following changes:

1. The background for the application should be blue.
1. They want the counter value to use a font that is TWO TIMES larger than what you have.
1. They want the counter value to be black numbers on a white background
1. They want the counter to fill 100% of the horizontal space and be the topmost element
1. They would like the corners rounded on the white background of the count field
1. They want the buttons for UP and DOWN to sit side by side directly underneath the count, each button should use half of the horizontal space
1. The UP and DOWN buttons should be light blue with black text, no border, and have rounded corners.
1. They want the RESET button to be full horizontal width, and sit underneath the UP and DOWN buttons
1. The RESET button should be an uninviting color (or have NO color) so the user doesn't want to click it.
1. They want some space between the UP and DOWN button row and the RESET button so they don't accidentally hit it

Copy your code from 1-counter here and make those changes
