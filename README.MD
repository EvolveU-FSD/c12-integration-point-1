# Skill Integration Day

We have gone through an introductory treatment of each of the three technologies used in web application development (HTML, CSS, and Javascript).  Try this set a exercises to put these skills together.

You will be working through the sub folders one at a time.  Each folder contains a "README.MD" and possible starting files for you applications.

Use LiveServer to run your applications.

## Sequence 

Everybody should start with 1-counter and 2-gui upgrade to get the day started.

If you are comfortable with development and/or javascript, you can skip to the 5-beginner-stopwatch and work up to 10.  Otherwise continue with 3 and 4.
