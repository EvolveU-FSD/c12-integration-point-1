Ok.  The reset button is still too easy to accidentally trigger.

You can come up with an idea to solve this problem, but the client has the following suggestions:
1. you have to hit the reset button more than once to actually get it to reset the count
1. make the reset button really small and stuck to the bottom right corner of the screen
1. you have to scroll to get to the reset button 
1. get the browser to show a "confirm" dialog (learn about and use confirm()) 

Copy your code from 1-counter or 2-gui-upgrade to start this task
