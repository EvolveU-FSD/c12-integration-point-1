Now that we have been using it a few days, we have discovered a new feature that we need.  It turns out at the start of the day we want to set the count to a particular value so we can pick up where we left off.  Also, we accidentally reload the page once in a while and the user normally remembers where they left off, so being able to enter the value for the counter is important in that case.

1. use an input to allow the user can enter the number they want to use as the current count

We can finally remove the RESET button, as we can use this feature to set the count to any value we want.

For an advanced option,  enable/disable the input field using a button to prevent accidental data entry.
