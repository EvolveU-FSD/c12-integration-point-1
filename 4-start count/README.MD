Now that we have been using it a few days, it turns out at the start of the day we want to set the count to a particular value so we can pick up where we left off.  Also, we accidentally reload the page once in a while and the user normally remembers where they left off

1. add an input that the user can enter the number they want to use into
1. add a button to lock in the value from the input

We can remove the RESET button, as we can use this feature to set the count to any value we want.
