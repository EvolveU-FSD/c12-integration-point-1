# Starting with a running readout

Start from the stopwatch in 6-stopwatch-buttons or 5-beginner-stopwatch or add a readout to 7-reaction-timer.

1. When the timer is running, show the value (in milliseconds) updating in real-time

Tip:
Use setInterval() to execute a callback function every 50 milliseconds
