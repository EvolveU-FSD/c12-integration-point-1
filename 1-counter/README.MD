# Counter

Your goal is to create a basic counter in html/css/javascript.  It is operated by a person who is counting people going in an out of a building.  It will have a readout of the current count along with three buttons:

Zero - sets the accumulated count zero
Up - will add one to the count
Down - will subtract one from the count

Every time the page is (re)loaded the counter should start at zero.

We will use the content-first method that follows this flow:
1. Create your html file and put content elements in it
1. Group your elements into containers and create styles 
1. Add javascript for each of your dynamic behaviors
